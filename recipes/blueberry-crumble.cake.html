            <h3>Steps</h3>

                <ol>
                    <li>First prepare the crumble; Melt the butter and put it aside to 
                        cool down a bit, then, in a bowl add the granulated sugar, the
                        flour, and the ground cinnamon, mix everything together using a
                        whisk. Finally add the melted butter and mix it using a spoon
                        until you obtain a crumbling "dough";</li>
                    <li>Using a stand mixer or a hand mixer, on the medium speed, whisk
                        the sugar, the oil, and the egss for 4-5 minutos or until you 
                        obtain a voluminous and pale misture;</li>
                    <li>Reduce the speed of the mixer to low and pour the milk slowly
                        by the sides of the bowl; Turn back the mixer to the medium
                        speed again, and whisk the mixture for 30 seconds or so;</li>
                    <li>Passing through a sieve, add the flour, the baking powder, and
                        the salt, whisk the batter just enough to disolve any lumps of
                        flour;</li>
                    <li>Finally, add the blueberries and fold it gently into the batter;</li>
                    <li>Pour the batter into a 9 inches loose bottom tin (greased and 
                        lined with baking paper), then, sprinkle the crumble all over
                        the top of the batter;</li>
                    <li>Take it to a preheated oven to 180ºC (or 350ºF) and bake it for
                        45-55 minutes or until you ckeck it with a skewer and it comes 
                        out clean;</li>
                    <li>If you'd like you can server it with some more blueberries aside
                        and a splash of double cream (or heavy cream) on top;</li>
