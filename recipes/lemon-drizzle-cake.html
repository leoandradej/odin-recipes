            <div class="steps">
            <h3>Steps</h3>

                <ol>
                    <li>Using a stand mixer or a hand mixer whisk the softened butter
                        and the sugar for 4-5 minutes until you have a voluminous and
                        pale cream;</li>
                    <li>Then, add the eggs one by one whisking very well after each
                        addition;</li>
                    <li>Finally add the flour and the lemon zests and whisk the
                        mixture just enough to disolve any flour lumps;</li>
                    <li>Pour the mixture into a greased loaf tin (I recommend lining
                        the tin with baking paper leaving some excess paper to
                        facilitate when you take the cake out of the tin)</li>
                    <li>In a preheated oven to 180ºC (or 350ºF) bake the batter for
                        45-55 minutes or until you check it with a skewer and it
                        comes out clean;</li>
                    <li>While the cake is cooling down for a bit prepare the drizzle,
                        for that just mix the lemon juice with the sugar using a
                        whisk until you obtain a thick-ish consistency;</li>
                    <li>With the cake still warm stab the whole surface of it
                        using a skewer and then pour the drizzle all over it;</li>
                    <li>After 10-15 minutes the cake will have completely absorbed
                        the drizzle, so you can take it out of the tin and serve it;</li>
                </ol>
