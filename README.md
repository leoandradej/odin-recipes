# odin-recipes
This project consists of building a simple Recipes Website containing an Index (or Home) page displaying links to three different recipe pages that should have a structure composed of a title, a picture of the dish with a brief description, followed by a list of ingredients needed and the steps of how to prepare the dish.

This project will be useful for put into practice what I've learned so far about HTML, for example, how to build the basic structure of a page and how to use indentation as a way to set hierarchy logic to a project; I will be able to stick to my mind some of the basic tags used in HTML by using them again and again.
